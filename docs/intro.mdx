# Welcome

## Save, Win, Support Public Goods 🏆✨
winETH is a charitable prize vault powered by PoolTogether & Aave on Optimism. 

It's a Win-Win situation:
- You have a chance to win WETH prizes in daily draws.  
- You're already winning by supporting public goods
- You never lose your principal.

For the first six months (until April 3rd, 2025), depositors earn additional bonus rewards. [Learn more](rewards.md)

## How does it work?
USDC is deposited into an Aave market to generate yield from lending to borrowers. This yield is contributed to the PoolTogether prize pool, giving depositors a chance to win. The prize pool automatically distributes prizes every day.

1/3 of all yield generated through winETH deposits is forwarded to a good cause, picked by depositors. The current beneficiary is Protocol Guild. 

## About PoolTogether
PoolTogether is a protocol for prize savings, designed to make saving money fun and rewarding. By depositing tokens, anyone gets a chance to win prizes without losing their principle. The more you save, the better your odds of winning. No Loss.

The first version of PoolTogether was launched in 2019. Since then, the protocol has awarded millions of dollars in prizes. The latest release is accessible through several apps at [pooltogether.com/interfaces](https://pooltogether.com/interfaces).
